## Overview

This project helps families coordinate care across language barriers, with a focus on medical documentation. While optimized for medical use cases, the tool can handle general Hungarian-to-English document translation. It provides:

- Secure document processing and OCR
- Privacy-preserving translation
- Side-by-side view of original and translated text

Future development will include medical terminology optimization and caregiver collaboration features.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hungarian-medical-translator 

cd hungarian-medical-translator 

pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Useage

Basic example of loading and processing a document will be added as functionality is developed.
